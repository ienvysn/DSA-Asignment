Now we focus on how many trucks can move from KTM to BS. This becomes a  maximum flow problem. KTM is the source because supplies start there. BS is the sink because that’s where we want to send supplies. Every road has a capacity, which means how many trucks per hour it can handle. The goal is to find the maximum number of trucks that can reach BS without breaking any capacity limit.

Even if we try to directly use probabilities and just try to maximize them, Dijkstra still doesn’t work properly. That’s because Dijkstra depends on the idea that once we choose the smallest distance to a node, it won’t change later. That works when we are adding numbers, but not when we are multiplying probabilities. Multiplication doesn’t follow the same behavior. So using probabilities directly would break the logic that makes Dijkstra correct.

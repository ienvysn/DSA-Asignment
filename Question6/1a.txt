Dijkstra’s algorithm normally works when we are trying to find the shortest path by adding distances. But in this problem, safety is calculated by multiplying probabilities along the path. So instead of adding numbers, we are multiplying them. Dijkstra is built around addition, not multiplication. Because of that, it doesn’t directly work for finding the path with the highest safety probability. The structure of the problem is different from what Dijkstra expects.
